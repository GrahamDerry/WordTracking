**Scene: A hospital room. A nurse enters to check on a patient who has recently undergone surgery.**

**Nurse:** *[Smiling]* Good morning, Mr. Johnson. How are you feeling today?  

**Patient:** *[Groans slightly]* Morning… I guess I’ve been better. My stomach still hurts a bit.  

**Nurse:** That’s understandable. You had abdominal surgery yesterday, so some discomfort is expected. On a scale from 1 to 10, how would you rate your pain?  

**Patient:** Maybe a six… it was worse earlier, but I think the meds are helping.  

**Nurse:** That’s good to hear. I’ll let the doctor know, but in the meantime, I can check if you’re due for another dose of pain relief soon.  

**Patient:** Thanks. And… my throat feels dry. Can I have some water?  

**Nurse:** I’ll get you some ice chips for now. Since you just had surgery, we want to take it slow with liquids to make sure your stomach handles it well.  

**Patient:** Alright… I guess that makes sense.  

**Nurse:** Also, have you tried getting up yet? Moving a little can help with circulation and recovery.  

**Patient:** No, not yet. I’m kinda nervous about it.  

**Nurse:** That’s completely normal, but I’ll be right here to help. We can start small—just sitting up first, then we’ll see how you feel.  

**Patient:** *[Takes a breath]* Okay… let’s try.  

**Nurse:** *[Gently assists him into a sitting position]* There you go. How does that feel?  

**Patient:** A little dizzy… but not too bad.  

**Nurse:** That’s okay. Let’s take a minute before we try standing. You’re doing great.  

**Patient:** *[Smiles weakly]* Thanks. I appreciate it.  

**Nurse:** Of course. That’s what I’m here for. Now, let’s take this one step at a time.
